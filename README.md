# SCUMM-VM for ESP32 / Odroid-Go

This is my try to port the SCUMM-VM (See: https://www.scummvm.org/) to ESP32. Currently it works with a lot of restrictions:
- Only works with MonkeyIsland1 CD-Version
- Only Engine is the SCUMM-Engine
- No Sound
- No Input except the START-Key (sending ESC)
...

But it proofs that SCUMM can run on the ESP32!
